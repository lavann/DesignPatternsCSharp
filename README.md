# Design Patterns in C# with a  Car Analogy

In this repository, I provide examples of various design patterns using C# and a car analogy to help understand their use cases and implementations. 
We cover several design patterns, including creational, structural, and behavioral patterns.

## Creational Patterns

The following creational patterns:

1. Singleton
2. Factory Method
3. Abstract Factory
4. Builder
5. Prototype

Each pattern has a unique purpose in object creation and helps to manage the complexity of object instantiation.

## Structural Patterns

Structural patterns deal with the composition of classes and objects. These patterns are:

1. Adapter
2. Bridge
3. Composite
4. Decorator
5. Facade
6. Flyweight
7. Proxy

These patterns focus on how objects and classes are composed to form larger structures.

## Behavioral Patterns

Behavioral patterns are concerned with the interaction and communication between objects. The patterns we discussed are:

1. Chain of Responsibility
2. Command
3. Interpreter
4. Iterator
5. Mediator
6. Memento
7. Observer
8. State
9. Strategy
10. Template Method
11. Visitor

Each pattern provides a solution for a specific problem related to object communication and collaboration.

 The examples demonstrated how each pattern can be applied to real-world scenarios and how they can be implemented in C#. 
 The car analogy helped to clarify the purpose and structure of each design pattern.

Overall, I hope this repository serves as a valuable resource for understanding design patterns and their implementation in C# using a car analogy.
